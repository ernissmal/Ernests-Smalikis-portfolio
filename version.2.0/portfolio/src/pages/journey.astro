        description: "My passion for technology began when I was just 10 years old, with a secondhand laptop and a curious mind. I started by writing simple bash scripts to exploit system quirks and uncover hidden operating system features. It wasn't about hacking—it was about understanding the machine to its core."

        description: "My first official project was born out of necessity. After becoming frustrated with the limitations of a well-known password generator, I decided to build my own in Python. That small decision evolved into the creation of a maintained tool now published under my brand. It became my entry point into product creation—and the start of a journey defined by problem-solving."

        description: "Throughout the years, hardware limitations have been a constant. I've built my workflow around tactical workarounds, customizations, and DIY repairs. Working under constraints taught me how to think lean, solve efficiently, and extract maximum value from every piece of equipment I've had."

        description: "At 18, I made a critical decision: I dropped out of Valmieras Tehnikums. It wasn't rebellion—it was a calculated choice to support myself and pursue programming full time. I later earned spots in bootcamps hosted by Accenture and Scandiweb, which helped refine my skills and expose me to team-based software development."

                                My learning process is straightforward: identify a problem, study the systems behind it, and build a solution. My inspiration in design and architecture often comes from Apple's products. Their seamlessness led me down a rabbit hole—taking apart devices, reading Steve Jobs' biography, studying design patterns, and building an understanding of what "intuitive" really means.

                            The most difficult thing I've had to learn isn't a programming language—it's that perfection is a myth. I've trained myself to resist the urge for completeness, and instead focus on release, feedback, and iteration.
