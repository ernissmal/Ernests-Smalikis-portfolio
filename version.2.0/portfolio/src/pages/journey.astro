                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">👶 Early Roots: Curiosity Turned Obsession</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    My passion for technology began when I was just 10 years old, with a secondhand laptop and a curious mind. I started by writing simple bash scripts to exploit system quirks and uncover hidden operating system features. It wasn't about hacking—it was about understanding the machine to its core.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🔑 First Steps: Frustration That Sparked Innovation</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    My first official project was born out of necessity. After becoming frustrated with the limitations of a well-known password generator, I decided to build my own in Python. That small decision evolved into the creation of a maintained tool now published under my brand. It became my entry point into product creation—and the start of a journey defined by problem-solving.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">⚙️ Working with Limitations</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    Throughout the years, hardware limitations have been a constant. I've built my workflow around tactical workarounds, customizations, and DIY repairs. Working under constraints taught me how to think lean, solve efficiently, and extract maximum value from every piece of equipment I've had.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🎓 Going Off-Road: Dropping Out & Doubling Down</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    At 18, I made a critical decision: I dropped out of Valmieras Tehnikums. It wasn't rebellion—it was a calculated choice to support myself and pursue programming full time. I later earned spots in bootcamps hosted by Accenture and Scandiweb, which helped refine my skills and expose me to team-based software development.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🧠 Learning Strategy: Reverse Engineering Excellence</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    My learning process is straightforward: identify a problem, study the systems behind it, and build a solution. My inspiration in design and architecture often comes from Apple's products. Their seamlessness led me down a rabbit hole—taking apart devices, reading Steve Jobs' biography, studying design patterns, and building an understanding of what "intuitive" really means.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🪞 The Hardest Lesson: Embracing Imperfection</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    The most difficult thing I've had to learn isn't a programming language—it's that perfection is a myth. I've trained myself to resist the urge for completeness, and instead focus on release, feedback, and iteration. Great products aren't perfect; they work as expected, anticipate the user's needs, and feel natural.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🧭 No Mentor, Just Mission</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    I've never had a mentor. What I do have is a clear goal, an unwavering vision, and a piece of advice from a teacher before I left school—advice that stuck and shaped the way I operate. Progress doesn't come from motivation alone; it comes from consistency, discipline, and a willingness to do the work even on the worst days.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🧱 Failures That Built Me</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    From quitting a job too soon to underestimating the value of relationships, I've made painful decisions. But failure, to me, has always been a checkpoint, not a dead-end. Every misstep sharpened my resilience and clarified my sense of direction.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🪖 Discipline Forged by Service</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    In 2024, I joined Latvia's National Guard. That decision reinforced everything I believed in: resilience, clarity under pressure, and operational discipline. It wasn't just military service—it was a training ground for entrepreneurship and leadership.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🏗️ The Present: From Coder to Creator</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    Today, I'm a self-employed engineer actively building LuceneX—an emerging brand focused on digital transformation for small and mid-size businesses. I deliver solutions in:

                <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">

                    <li>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                    After nearly 6 years of hands-on programming, I've realized I'm not just here to code—I'm here to build the future. I want to help businesses thrive by giving them more time, better tools, and a tech foundation that fuels sustainable growth.

                <p class="text-lg italic border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 mt-8">
                    Every challenge became a stepping stone. I'm not where I want to be yet — but every day, I build closer to that.
