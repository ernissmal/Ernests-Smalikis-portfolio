        description: "My passion for technology began when I was just 10 years old, with a secondhand laptop and a curious mind. I started by writing simple bash scripts to exploit system quirks and uncover hidden operating system features. It wasn't about hacking‚Äîit was about understanding the machine to its core."

        description: "My first official project was born out of necessity. After becoming frustrated with the limitations of a well-known password generator, I decided to build my own in Python. That small decision evolved into the creation of a maintained tool now published under my brand. It became my entry point into product creation‚Äîand the start of a journey defined by problem-solving."

Working under constraints taught me how to think lean, solve efficiently, and extract maximum value from every piece of equipment I've had."

        description: "At 18, I made a critical decision: I dropped out of Valmieras Tehnikums. It wasn't rebellion‚Äîit was a calculated choice to support myself and pursue programming full time. I later earned spots in bootcamps hosted by Accenture and Scandiweb, which helped refine my skills and expose me to team-based software development."

                                My learning process is straightforward: identify a problem, study the systems behind it, and build a solution. My inspiration in design and architecture often comes from Apple's products. Their seamlessness led me down a rabbit hole‚Äîtaking apart devices, reading Steve Jobs' biography, studying design patterns, and building an understanding of what "intuitive" really means.
